For simple typos and obvious clarifications go ahead and submit a PR.

For more substantial changes, here's some ideas how to articulate your RFC/proposal:

- try to review previous proposals in case similiar ideas were already proposed
- state clearly what problem your proposal is trying to address
- if you file an issue rather than a concrete PR, state precisely what you intend to change
- describe how your change helps addressing the problem
- describe any disadvantages/trade-offs of the proposal you are aware of
- describe implications for backward compatibility or changes to Cabal needed
