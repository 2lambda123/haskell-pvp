# Haskell Package Version Policy (PVP) Specification

This repository is the home of the specification of [Haskell's PVP](http://pvp.haskell.org/) which together
with the [*Common Architecture for Building Applications and Tools* (CABAL)](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/proposal/pkg-spec.pdf)
specification provides the foundational framework powering [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org),
Haskell's central package repository.

## Proposing Changes

The PVP evolves over time to adapt to changing requirements of the community.
Everyone is invited to propose and discuss changes to the policy.

Formally, the PVP is maintained by the [Core Libraries Committee](https://wiki.haskell.org/Core_Libraries_Committee)
together with the [Hackage Trustees](https://github.com/haskell-infra/hackage-trustees).

Please review the [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING).
